AI model which recognises objects in given images. 
Both Models are trained using CIFAR 100 dataset

Code is in jupyter notebook attached

There are 2 models which are trained separately.
One is a CNN model and the other is an SVM model.

CNNs can develop new hidden layers to break down and distinguish features or properties of an object in the image, as it's being trained.
SVMs can be used to draw the best line/curve of seperation between different clusters of data.
